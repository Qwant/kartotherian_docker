# kartotherian

`kartotherian` is a server providing map tiles. It requires `node.js` to run. You can see more information about it on its [official repository](https://github.com/kartotherian/kartotherian).

Please note that we use our own [fork](https://github.com/qwantresearch/kartotherian).

It is generally used with `tilerator` which is used to generate map tiles (to put it simply). You can see the official repository [here](https://github.com/kartotherian/kartotherian/blob/master/packages/tilerator/README.md). Just like `kartotherian`, we have our own [fork](https://github.com/QwantResearch/tilerator).
